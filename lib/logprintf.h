 Initialize the logging system configuration.

 lvl:
   cut-off priority, above which log messages are simply ignored

 id:
   constant string to prepend to log messages; if the object
   referenced ceases to exist, the behavior is undefined;
   NULL or argv[0] (the program name) are sensible choices

 mode:
   any bitwise-or'd combination of one or more of LOG_TO_FILE
   and LOG_TO_SYSLOG, or zero (logging disabled)

 fp:
   file pointer to use when logging to a file

 NOTE: Can be called repeatedly to change the configuration on
 the fly. If not called explicitly beforehand, the equivalent of
 logprintf_init( LOG_DEBUG, NULL, LOG_TO_FILE, stderr ); is
 executed exactly once upon the first logging action.

 NOTE: If desirable, syslog specific settings can be tweaked by
 *subsequently* calling the openlog() function explicitly, with
 custom parameters.

 Log a formatted message at the specified priority. Supported are
 all format specifiers recognized by printf(), and additionally the
 syslog-style "%m" sequence, which consumes no argument but instead
 is replaced by a textual error description equivalent to what can
 be obtained by calling strerror_r(errno).

 NOTE: Although the %m sequence is supported in file mode as well,
 it comes at the cost of considerably increased processing effort.

 In file mode log lines follow the format "TS ID[PID]:PRI: MSG",
 where:
  TS : local time in ISO8601 format: yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS.uuuuuuÂ±ZZ:zz
  ID : source identifier as set via logprintf_init(), or "(null)"
  PID: process ID
  PRI: priority
  MSG: formatted message

 CAVEAT: Terminating linefeeds are not added automatically in file
 mode, they have to be included in the formatted message.
