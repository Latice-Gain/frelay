Outstanding TODOs In no particular order
----------------------------------------

GENERAL: Provide means to create a distribution tarball (WIP)

GENERAL: Support for broadcast / multicast transfers
         (Requires server side chaching.)

GENERAL: Implement FILEHASH and TTL attributes

GENERAL: Complete TheFineManual

SERVER: Command line options & config file support

CLIENT: Guard against overwriting existing target files during download
        (E.g., append parenthesized index to filename?)

CLIENT: Minimal command line editing and history support?

CLIENT: If run non-interactively, prefix every console output line with
        some context specific, easy to parse tag to simplify frontend
        programming.


On hold:

Note: This requires some serious consideration and research.
GENERAL: Implement encrypted authentication incl. nonce generation, etc.


Implemented:
------------
2016-08-04  Urban Wallasch  <irrwahn35@freenet.de> SVN r442
GENERAL: Support plain-text password authentication

2016-08-03  Urban Wallasch  <irrwahn35@freenet.de> SVN r442
SERVER: Fancy MotD  :-)  [Capture output of external command?]

2016-08-03  Urban Wallasch  <irrwahn35@freenet.de> SVN r441
CLIENT: Add command to paste the output of an external program.

2016-08-03  Urban Wallasch  <irrwahn35@freenet.de> SVN r440
CLIENT: Capability to cancel outstanding offers / transfer in progress
        Bonus points for providing command(s) to list offers / tansfers.
        Ignored (not as trivial as it seems):
        Assign each transfer a short client side "slot" number to simplify
        command typing, i.e. "acc #1" instead of "acc b16b000b5babecafe"?
